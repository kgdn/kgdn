# Hi, I'm Kieran.

Hey there, welcome to my GitHub page! This is where I'll be sharing some of my open source projects, which could be related to my university work or just some of my personal projects that I'd like to show off to the internet. Feel free to give feedback on any of the projects!

As for my interests, they mainly revolve around:

- 💻 Web Development
- 🔒 Cyber Security & Privacy
- 🐧 GNU/Linux and Unix-like operating systems
